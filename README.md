Resque-pool is a great gem, but is no longer actively maintained. This patch is necessary if you want to take advantage of Resque's updated term signal handling. It further includes patches from the gem [resque-heroku-signals](https://github.com/iloveitaly/resque-heroku-signals), which account for Heroku's practice of sending a SIGTERM to both parent *and* child processes.
