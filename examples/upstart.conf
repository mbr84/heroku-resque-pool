# This script assumes you will deploy new application code by using
# something similar to upstart-reload.conf which runs a second copy of
# the application then shuts down the first when ready to fork.  The
# --lock argument should point to a file that is accessible across
# deploys (i.e. not under a capistrano versioned path).  setuidgid is
# only necessary if you are running an older version of upstart such as
# the one included with RHEL/Centos 6.  In Upstart 1.4 and above you can
# use the setuid and setgid directives instead.
